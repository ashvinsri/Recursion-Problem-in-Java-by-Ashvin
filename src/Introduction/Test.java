Recursion:-

Recursion is the method where solution to a problem depends on solution to smaller instances of the same problem

We call it a magic you know why???

because without writing whole code we can solve the problem

Identification:-  So how will you identify the recursion???

When there is a choice based on decision then we use recursion okkkk...

Suppose we have to print 1 to n
so if we print 1 to n-1    f(n-1) // Hypothesis
then print n exclusively    //Induction
then u think upto where we have to go or where we shoul stop???
this is called base condition if(n==1) return 1
fn(4)
{
if(n==1)
return 1;
f(n-1)
cout<<n;

}
